==========

Behold, you are to visit my library full of .NET hacks, better prepare for it. You'll see lots of weird, but mostly working code. It heavily uses reflection and memory hacking to access parts of .NET that are normally inaccessible. I give you no warranty that it won't do something harmful, but I've tried to make it as much safe as possible. 
If you see some error in this code, feel free to commit a fix!  
You are free to download parts of this library and use them in your code, but please don't claim them as your own and remember who the original author was. 

## Namespaces

### Accessing
Classes generalizing the concept of accessors, objects that work as generic references.

### COM
Some interfaces and marshallers that make working with COM easier.

### Coroutines
Concept of Lua-like coroutines.

### Globalization
Methods to work with languages.

### Interop
Lots of tools to help with C interop and p/invoke. Worth seeing.

### Linq
Tools to help with writing one-line code.

### Math
Just math... mostly.

### Metadata
Some attributes with no real importance.

### Numerics
Real math and algebra.

### Reflection
Lots of code working with types, signatures, tokens, etc.

### Serialization
Just some tools to convert object to bytes.

### Streaming
Object streams and enumerables.

### Templates
Static interfaces. Accessing static classes with common pattern.

### Threads
Little threading tools.

### Unsafe
Code relying heavily on memory layout of objects. The most heretic - and most used - part of the library.
